# **Sorting methods**

This file has 2 subsections as can be seen above

1. by user input

2. by generating Random list

There are 4 sorting methods explained in each of the above sections, namely

1. Bubble sorting

2. Selection sorting

3. Insertion sorting

4. Merge sorting.


The main part of the code and working remains totally same in both the above methods.

The first method asks the user for creating the list on which sort algorithms will work.

The second method generates a random list using imported modules and implements the sort algorithm.
