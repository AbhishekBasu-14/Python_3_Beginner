# **Generating Random List**

Using numpy and random modules

numpy.random.randint() is one of the function for doing random sampling in numpy. It returns an array of specified shape and fills it with random integers from low (inclusive) to high (exclusive), i.e. in the interval [low, high).

When to use :-

When we want the computer to pick a random number in a given range.

If we wanted a random integer, we can use the randint function.

This was just a basic introduction which was required as we will use this in topics discussed uner Week 2 tasks. There are many other methods available for different random list generation in the random module.
