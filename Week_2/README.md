# **Week 2 challenge - Beginner tasks**

The following topics have been discussed in this tutorial-

1. Sorting method

2. Searching method

3. Basic intro to time, numpy and random modules

Four sorting methods have been discussed here- Bubblesort, Selection sort, Insertion sort and Merge sort.

Two searching methods have been discussed- Binary search and Linear search.

Each of the above topics have been coded in two different ways-

1. by taking user from input

2. by generting a Random List.

The time taken by each algorithm is calculated using time module.

Random lists are generated using numpy and random module.

A basic introduction of all the 3 modules are given in the google colab notebook above.

When working on a generated random list, the following analysis was done-

1. Merge sort took the least time for sorting.

2. Selection and Insertion sort takes almost similar time for sorting.

3. Bubble sort took the maximum time.

However, the amount of time a sorting algorithm takes depends on the generated data-

1. Best case scenario- generated list is already sorted, so it takes minimum time to generate the result.

2. Worst case scenario- generated list is exactly opposite to what required i.e if we desire ascending order, generated list is in descending order. This takes maximum time.

3. Partially sorted data- the most common scenario. Average time can be calculated using a method of time module.

# **Codechef solutions**

A variety of problem statements of different difficulty levels are there at www.codechef.com.

A few beginner level problems were selected at randomand they have been coded using python 3. These solutions helps to understand when to use what and how to select an algorithm while working on a problem statement.

Each code has commented lines to give a deeper insight and knowledge.

Happy learning !!!
